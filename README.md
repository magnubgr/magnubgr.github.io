## Work Experience
**Hardware Test Engineer @ Novelda  (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- PCB Design: Development kits, internal tools and flex cables, Panel design and DFM/DFT
- Testing of modules for customer sampling and internal use
- Assembly of PCBs, soldering, stencil-printing, reflow
- RMA handling and FA (failure analysis)
- Scripting, processing and storage of test result data in Azure

**Test & Validation Engineer (Part-time & internship) @ Novelda  (_May 2021 - June 2022_)**
- Processing and visualization of data from IC production testing. (_Python, Power BI, Azure Storage, Azure Functions_).

**SW Developer Internship @ Eiendomsverdi (_Summer 2020_)**
- Developed a machine learning model with PyTorch for image classification
- React frontend and a Flask API backend fetching data from an SQL server.
- Machine learning model resulted in a 90% accuracy.

**Data entry and SW development (Part-time) @ Eiendomsverdi (_March 2019 - March 2021_)**
- Part-time job with data entry and manual quality control of data. Also smaller software development assignments.
- Took initiative to streamline the data entry process through Python-scripts and a JavaScript Chrome-extension.

**Scientific Research Assistant @ Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt  (_Summer 2018 and Summer 2019_)**
- Modelling and simulation of interceptor missiles. Python for simulations, processing and parallelization.
